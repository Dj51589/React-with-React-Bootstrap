This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Use React Bootstrap

### Step 1: Install React Bootstrap
Run: `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` in your project folder to install React-Bootstrap in Application.

### Step 2: Include Style Sheet
Include Bootstrap Style File in your index.html.It will add updated styles to your component.

`<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T"
  crossorigin="anonymous" /> `

### Step 3: Include Component
Import React-Bootstrap in your React Component file and use whatever Bootstrap Component you need.<br>
For Eg: I am using Button, Navbar etc. component in my demo.

`import { Button , Navbar, Nav , NavDropdown, DropdownButton, Dropdown } from 'react-bootstrap';`

### Step 4: Start Using
Use component as described in Component API. You can find here all bootstrap components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
